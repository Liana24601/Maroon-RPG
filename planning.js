this file is gonna be used for planning out the whole story
game name: red stains and gold eyes
(sorry if the commit timings are kinda weird, i got so invested writing this that i forgot to commit sometimes mb)

basic story bullet points:
- Thespian Robbie with gold eyeliner, like how cinna from the hunger games wore gold eyeliner 
- How they meet: hang out after a party. In Robbie’s apartment. Robbie spills wine on the main character's burgundy t-shirt. They both collapse in giggles
- Robbie: “How'd we end up on the floor anyway?"      Main character: “Your roommate's cheap-ass screw-top rosé, that's how” (lyric from the song)
- More cute Robbie scenes showing his friendliness and initial charm ( shoeless dancing in New York, putting bandages on her collarbone cut, long calls on the landline “rust”)
- MC means main character. Maroon becomes MCs fav color
- MC falls cause Robbie is charming, dramatic, sweet, and lights up a room
- Robbie’s a theater kid, born for the stage. It’s his greatest dream. MC is a comp sci major, just for the money “you hate to code, but you need it.”
- A huge reason MC falls is because of his theater stuff. Robbie is so passionate about it. He’s convinced he’ll die if he doesn’t make it to broadway. He’s a true New York dreamer, believing the city is one that gives birth to stars
- MC envies this , unlike Robbie she’s introverted and boring. She picked comp sci not because she loves it, but because it’s a reliable career.
- Shows the growing problems between Robbie and MC
- His cute theater things are getting annoying. He makes every molehill a mountain. He doesn’t pitch in money at all. He’s obsessed with the unachievable. He uses acting and dramatics to avoid hard conversations, He thinks he’ll be able to reach broadway when so many others failed. He goes to auditions and gets nothing for it. MC starts to hate him even more. (might cut this part)
- Then the apartment floods. It’ll take funds to fix it. MC takes funds from Robbie’s savings for an art college.
- When Robbie finds out he throws a fit. He cries he curses he recites angry Shakespeare lines like he’ll die. The last time he was this sad was when he had bought her carnations instead of roses by accident. MC wishes he’d shut up. She regrets ever meeting him. She voices everything she loathes about him, his her envy turned into pure hatred. They storm out into the apartment stairs they’re yelling. She pushes him down the stairs.
- The neighbor comes out and she lies. She says robbie fell, and begs her to call an ambulance. The blood that spills from the crack on Robbie’s head is so beautifully maroon somehow. He looked “Hollow eyed” MC thinks Hell, my acting is super. Maybe i was the one meant for broadway. 
- MC sees maroon in everything now. In the ambulance. In the siren. in the sunset that seems to taunt her. Robbie, all red blood and smudged eyeliner, haunts her like a Shakespeare ghost. He whispers snide comments at her back day by day. Sometimes in iambic pentameter.
- end: MC  has become a terrible person. Sees maroon in everything. In Rockefeller center, sees a girl near the ice skating rink wearing a maroon shirt, like the one MC wore. In a fit of rage, and blinded by guilt, the MC follows her into an alley and st*bs with a knife, ghost Robbie convinces her to. Red everywhere.
- The police find MC sitting in a pool of blood, laughing hysterically, maroon everywhere.

Actual gameplay:

Part 1 (wine spill, meet after the party, laughing Robbie's apartment):

You never wanted to kill him.
You remember him. The air smelt of cheap incense and theater dust.
Robbie spins in the living room, still in costume, wearing gold eyeliner that catches the warm kitchen light.
He twirls a wine glass, trips over a throw pillow, and crashes to the hardwood.
The rosé flies—dark, staining, like a wound—across your burgundy shirt.
You gasp. His laugh bubbles up like a musical cue.
Both of you helplessly collapse into the ground, giggling until you can't breathe properly.
Lying on the floor, inches apart, his perfect gold eyeliner glints brightly.
After the play, he told you he wore it because he wanted to look like Cinna from the Hunger Games.
He catches you staring."New thing I’m trying out. Does it look good on me?"
How do you respond?
    1. It's the stupidest thing I've ever seen. So ugly.
    2. Yeah, it really suits you!
    3. You look beautiful.")
1 = He laughs. "Geez, you didn't pull back any punches, huh?"
2 = Thanks, love."Your heart flutters."
3 = He smiles. "Not much as you though."
nothing = He blinks at you, confused. "Was that a yes or a no?"
He looks around the apartment.
"How'd we end up on the floor anyway?" Robbie asks you breathlessly. 
"Your roommate’s cheap-ass screw-top rosé, that’s how." You shoot back.
You both collapse in laughter. That dirty t-shirt will never be the same.  
You’ll keep it anyway.

Part 2 - The Flashback, dancing in Times Square, 2AM, Robbie acting crazy

New York at 2AM. Robbie dances in the streetlight puddles like he’s auditioning for God.
You’re pulled along, laced fingers, as he quotes something Shakespearean under his breath.
Robbie: "I'm telling you, I was born to dance under the Times Square billboards!" he yells to you gleefully.") 
You laugh as you study him. You, the hardworking, steadfast comp sci major.
Him, the theater nerd that thinks he'll make it to Broadway.
You hate to code, but...it's stable. Reliable. A promising future, even if you loathe it.
But Robbie? He's a true New York dreamer. All open flame and delusion. Theatrics and melodrama.
You can't imagine having that much passion.
He continues his dancing in the Times Square lights. People stare, but he doesn't seem to care.
How do you respond?
    1. What are you doing?"
    2. You're embarrassing yourself."
    3. People are staring, my guy.")
    4. (Say nothing)
1 = He grins. "Whatever I want!"
2 = "At least I'm not being boring like you, Mrs. Grinch!" He laughs.
3 = "Who cares?" he yells with glee. "As Shakespeare once said, 'All the world's a stage!'"
4 = Robbie waves his arms and does a silly dance to make you laugh. It works.
nothing = Robbie cocks his head. "That wasn't one of the options, genius."
You sigh as you watch him finish his crazy performance.
You envy him. Maybe even love him.

The Flood & the Funds

You step into the apartment. The water comes up to your knees. The radiator screams.
You panic. Not because the flood destroyed your and Robbie's apartment.
But because you don't have the money to fix it.
Your heartbeat quickens. Your palms sweat. The repair bills will crush you.
All those dreams of a stable life...
Gone.
You know where Robbie hides things — he’s careless that way. He trusts too easily.
You need money to fix the apartment. His funds for acting school... it’s somewhere.
Where will you look?
    1. Under Robbie's mattress
    2. Inside his folder of audition scripts
    3. In the dusty teapot on the shelf
    4. Behind the giant WICKED poster
1, 2, 4 = Empty. Dust. Nada. Try again.
3 = The teapot rattles with hidden weight. Inside: an envelope, labeled 'Broadway, here I come!'. You hold the cash and whisper an apology he’ll never hear. Not really.

The Argument

He finds out.
Robbie: "You took it? You actually—you used the money?!"
His eyes glisten with tears. That same gold eyeliner, now a mockery.
Choose your reply:
    1. "I did what I had to. You’d never have made it."
    2. "I needed it. Our apartment was drowning, Robbie!"
    3. "You and your stupid dreams. I'm tired of this nonsense."
1 = He goes still. The hurt sinks deep. Robbie: "I guess I never knew you at all, Scarlett."
2 = He shakes his head in disbelief. "So you just decided my dream was worthless?"
3 = He screams. Quoting Shakespeare. Crying like his heart’s been pierced. You feel nothing. Or maybe too much.
nothing = You say nothing. The silence crushes him.

The Push

Both of you exit the apartment in a rushed fury.
The metal stairwell echoes with both your screams. Gold eyeliner streaks. Your anger spills raw.
But when Robbie is shouting at you, there is more sadness than anger in his eyes.
He looks exactly like he did a year ago, on your birthday.
"I can't believe I messed up so badly." He said back then with a sigh.
As a gift, he bought you carnations instead of roses. You laughed it off as a simple mistake.
"But you remember the guilt and sorrow in his gold-lined eyes.
It mirrors the eyes you see right now.

"I can't believe I messed up so badly." He said back then with a sigh.
What do you say to him?
1. It's alright, things happen.
2. Bad mistake, man. I guess I could buy more flowers?
3. At least they'll still look pretty on the windowsill!

1 - He forces a smile that doesn't make you feel quite nice.
2 - His head drops in shame. You change the topic, as you regret making him feel bad with a single comment.
3 - He laughs. You can still see the guilt in his face as you laugh with him. You hope that he'll forget about it like he always does.
And then go back to:

But you remember the guilt and sorrow in his gold-lined eyes.
It mirrors the eyes you see right now.

Anger flashes through your head. So do your memories.
Dancing in NYC streets. Cafe dates and junk food. Hour-long calls on rusty landlines.
You did it to save him! To save the apartment you both shared!
He wouldn't ever succeed anyway, deluded by an impossible dream.
How could he not understand?
How could he act like this to you?
How could he stand there, throwing a fit like an angry child?
You realize that you hate him.
You realize that you want him gone.

He turns to leave. You shove.

A sickening crack. The blood spreads like spilled paint. Maroon.
His eyeliner smears like a final curtain call.
The neighbor, an old lady, opens her door. You sob. You act.

What do you say to the neighbor?")
    1. "Please, I need your help. It's serious."
    2. "Call an ambulance. Now."
    3. "I—I think he's dying."
    4. "Say nothing. Just sob."

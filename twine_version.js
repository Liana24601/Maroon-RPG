(( DESIGN & ADD TITLE SLIDE ))

// Begin

You never wanted to kill him.

// Continue

You remember him. The air smelt of cheap incense and theater dust.

// Continue

Robbie spins in the living room, still in costume, wearing gold eyeliner that catches the warm kitchen light.

// Continue

He twirls a wine glass, trips over a throw pillow, and crashes to the hardwood.

// Continue

The rosé flies—dark, staining, like a wound—across your burgundy shirt.

// Continue

You gasp. His laugh bubbles up like a musical cue.

// Continue

Both of you helplessly collapse into the ground, giggling until you can't breathe properly.

// Continue

Lying on the floor, inches apart, his perfect gold eyeliner glints brightly.

// Continue

After the play, he told you he wore it because he wanted to look like Cinna from the Hunger Games.

// Continue

He catches you staring. "New thing I’m trying out. Does it look good on me, Scarlett?"

// Continue

How do you respond?
- It's the stupidest thing I've ever seen. So ugly. // Response 1
- Yeah, it really suits you! // Response 2
- You look beautiful. // Response 3

Response 1:

"It's the stupidest thing I've ever seen. So ugly." You tell him.
He laughs. "Geez, you didn't pull back any punches, huh?"

// Continue

Response 2:

"Yeah, it really suits you!" You tell him.
He smiles warmly. "Thanks, love." Your heart flutters.

// Continue

Response 3:

He smiles. "Not much as you though."
You blush.

// Continue

He looks around the apartment.

// Continue

"How'd we end up on the floor anyway?" Robbie asks you.

// Continue

"Your roommate’s cheap-ass screw-top rosé, that’s how." You shoot back.

// Continue

You both collapse in laughter. That dirty t-shirt will never be the same.

// Continue

You’ll keep it anyway.

// Continue

- THE FLASHBACK -

New York at 2AM. Robbie dances in the streetlight puddles like he’s auditioning for God.

// Continue

You’re pulled along, laced fingers, as he quotes Shakespeare and grins like a child on Christmas morning.

// Continue

"I'm telling you, I was born to dance under the Times Square billboards!" he yells to you gleefully.

// Continue

You laugh as you study him. You, the hardworking, steadfast computer science major.

// Continue

Him, the theater nerd that thinks he'll make it to Broadway.

// Continue

You hate to code, but...it's stable. Reliable. A promising future, even if you loathe it.

// Continue

But Robbie? He's a true New York dreamer. All open flame and delusion. Theatrics and melodrama.

// Continue

You can't imagine having that much passion.

// Continue

He continues his dancing in the Times Square lights. People stare, but he doesn't seem to care.

// Continue

How do you respond?

- What are you doing?. // Answer 1
- You're embarrassing yourself. // Answer 2
- People are staring, my guy. // Answer 3

Answer 1:

"What are you doing?" You ask.
He grins. "Whatever I want!"

// Continue

Answer 2:

"You're embarrassing yourself. " You say to him.
"At least I'm not being boring like you, Mrs. Grinch!" He laughs.

// Continue

Answer 3:

"People are staring, my guy." You laugh.
"Who cares?" he yells with glee. "As Shakespeare once said, 'All the world's a stage!'"

// Continue

You sigh as you watch him finish his crazy performance.

// Continue

You envy him. Maybe even love him.

// Continue

- THE FLOOD -

// Continue

You step into the apartment. The water comes up to you knees. The radiator screams.

// Continue

You panic. Not because the flood destroyed your and Robbie's apartment.

// Continue

But because you don't have the money to fix it.

// Continue

Your heartbeat quickens. Your palms sweat. The repair bills will crush you.

// Continue

All those dreams of a stable life...

// Continue

Gone.

// Continue

You think. You know where Robbie hides things - he's careless that way. He trusts too easily.

// Continue

You need money to fix the apartment. His funds for acting school... it's somewhere.

// Continue

Where will you look?

- Under Robbie's mattress. // Response 1.
- Inside his folder of audition scripts. // Response 2.
- In the dusty teapot on the shelf. // Response 3.
- Behind the giant WICKED poster. // Response 4.
- But...I don't want to steal his money. // Response 5.

Response 1. -

You lift the mattress of Robbie's bed and look beneath.
All you see are white sheets and dust bunnies.

Go back to // Flood Question

Response 2. -

You leaf through the stacks of crinkled audition scripts, covered in highlighter ink.
You see familiar titles. Romeo & Juliet. Into the Woods. Hamlet. But you find nothing.

Go back to // Flood Question

Response 3. -

The dusty teapot rattles with hidden weight. You lift the lid to find an envelope, labeled "Broadway, here I come!"
You hold the cash and whisper an apology he’ll never hear.

// Continue

Response 4. - 

You tear the WICKED poster from the wall, watching the limp paper fall to the floor.
Behind it, you find only empty wall and cracked paint.

Go back to // Flood Question

Response 5. -

"But...I don't want to steal his money." You think to yourself.
"Aw, that's sweet," sneers the voice in your head, "but I don't think you have a another choice unless you want to lose everything you've worked for so far."
"So do it."

Go back to // Flood Question

You feel watched as you hold the cash in your trembling palm. The apartment is still, but somehow hostile.

// Continue

- THE ARGUMENT -

He finds out.

// Continue

His voice trembles as he yells as you. "You took it? You actually-you used the money?!"

// Continue

His eyes glisten with tears. That same gold eyeliner, now mockery.

// Continue

Choose your reply:
- I did what I had to do. You'd never make it anyways. // Option 1
- I needed it. Our apartment was drowning, Robbie! // Option 2
- You and your stupid dreams. I'm tired of this nonsense. // Option 3

Option 1:

He goes still. The hurt sinks deep.
"I guess I never knew you at all, Scarlett."
You get angry. You reply harshly, and it devolves into a shouting match.

// Continue

Option 2:

He shakes his head in disbelief. "So you just decided my dream was worthless?"
You nod your head. He flies into a dramatic rage.

// Continue

Option 3:

He screams. Quoting Shakespeare. Crying like his heart’s been pierced.
You feel nothing. Or maybe too much.

// Continue

Both of you exit the apartment in a rushed fury.

Little did you know, in 5 minutes Robbie's life would be over.

// Continue

- THE STAIRWELL -

// Continue

The metal stairwell echoes with both your screams. Gold eyeliner streaks. Your anger spills raw.

// Continue

But when Robbie is shouting at you, there is more sadness than anger in his eyes.

// Continue

He looks exactly like he did a year ago, on your birthday.

// Continue

"I can't believe I messed up so badly." he said back then with a sigh.

// Continue

As a gift, he accidentally bought you carnations instead of roses.

// Continue

What do you say to him?
- It's alright, things happen. // Option 1
- Bad mistake, man. I guess I could buy more flowers? // Option 2
- At least they'll still look pretty on the windowsill! // Option 3

Option 1:

"It's alright, things happen." you console him.
He forces a smile, leaving you relieved and only a little concerned.

// Continue

Option 2:

"Bad mistake, man. I guess I could buy more flowers?" You tell him.
His head drops in shame. You change the topic, as you regret making him feel so bad.

// Continue 

Option 3:

"At least they'll still look pretty on the windowsill!" You say cheerfully.
He laughs. You can still see the guilt in his face as you laugh with him. You hope that he'll forget about it like he always does.

// Continue

But months later, you remember the guilt and sorrow in his gold-lined eyes.

// Continue

It mirrors the eyes you see right now.

// Continue

Anger flashes through your head. So do your memories.

// Continue

Dancing in NYC streets. Cafe dates and junk food. Hour-long calls on rusty landlines.

// Continue

You did this for your future together. Does the time you've spent together mean nothing to him?!

// Continue

He wouldn't suceed anyway, deluded by an impossible dream.

// Continue

How could he not understand?

// Continue

How could he act like this to you?

// Continue

How could he stand there, throwing a fit like an angry child?

// Continue

You realize that you hate him.

// Continue

You realize that you want him gone.

// Continue

He turns to leave. You shove.

// Continue

You watch as he falls down the steps. Hitting every one with a gut dropping thump.

// Continue

A sickening crack. The blood spreads like spilled paint. Maroon.

// Continue

His eyeliner smears like a final curtain call.

// Continue

The neighbor, an old lady, opens her door. You sob. You act.

// Continue

What do you say to the neighbor?
- Please, I need your help. It's serious. // Answer 1
- Call an ambulence. Now. // Answer 2
- I...I think he's dying. // Answer 3
- Say nothing. Just sob. // Answer 4

Answer 1:

Your voice cracks. "Please, I need your help. It's serious."
She fumbles for her phone, nodding quickly.

// Continue

Answer 2:

You yell the order, panicked. "Call an ambulance. Now."
Startled, she stares for half a second, and then dials with shaking fingers.

// Continue

Answer 3:

You clutch at her sleeve. "I—I think he's dying."
Her face drains of color. She pulls out her phone immediately and dials 9-1-1.

// Continue

Answer 4:

You say nothing. Just sob—loud, messy, uncontrollable.
She takes one look at you, and starts dialing 9-1-1 without a word.

// Continue

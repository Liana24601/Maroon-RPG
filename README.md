# The Game

Writing stories based off my favorite songs has always been a fun pastime for me. This year, I thought I would take that hobby to the next level. I made my first ever RPG game based off Taylor Swift's song "Maroon". With masterful storytelling, well-crafted writing, poetic lyric snippets, and a thrilling atmospshere, I believe this game is definitely something to see. Enjoy!

#

# The game includes...

- Intriguing characters
- Chilling writing
- Tough decisions
- Pyschological thrillers
- A supspenseful mystery
- Multiple storylines
- Stunning visuals
- And a dark ending!
